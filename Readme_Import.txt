Important information on using the NX Clone files and PLMXML files for importing CAD data in Teamcenter Environment

Technical Marketing has provided couple of options for you to import data in the Teamcenter environment
1) PLMXML : Teamcenter user can opt to use PLMXML files to import data in the server. This technology is very useful to non- NX community users, who wish to use the CAD data geometry for visualization purpose only in their demo. Users need not have NX installed on their machine while importing. Just have a 4 Tier install on local laptop pointing to the server on local VM or Cloud (PlCloud / AWS). Currently, the PLMXML export files has pre-configured Item ID and ITEM type "ITEM". In case, you wish to have different ITEM ID & ITEM type options like "Design", "Part"; please use the NX Clone file for importing.

2) NX Clone : Core NX users, can opt to use this importing technology to import data in their Teamcenter server as per their custom Item ID and Item Type. Users are expected to have latest NX install and 4 Tier Teamcenter install on their local machine pointing to the server on local VM or Cloud (PlCloud / AWS).
